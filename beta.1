.TH BETA 1 2018 "Alexander Shpilkin"
.SH NAME 
beta \- sample binomial distributions
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B beta
.I count
.SH DESCRIPTION
Given a population size
.I N
and a sample
.I n
from a binomial distribution with parameters
.RI ( N ,
.IR p ),
.I beta
computes
.I count
more samples from it, assuming a uniform Bayesian prior for the unknown
parameter
.IR p .

The input values
.I N
and
.I n
are read from standard input, in this order, separated by whitespace. Several
distributions can be specified, one per line. For each distribution,
.I count
lines are written, containing the population size
.IR N
the sampled value. The values on output are separated by a single tab
character.
.SH LIMITATIONS
The population size
.I N
is limited to about 30000, which is also the range of values for which
.I beta
can be expected to produce reasonably accurate results with acceptable speed.
